**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** <br />
I think the most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is the analysis on sepsis data and the way different tables are combined to provide a full picture.
**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** <br />
Since we already have experiences with medical data, I think a potential investigation would be on diabetes and its specific treatments.
**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** <br />
I'd make the change that all the tables in the new dataset will need to be familiarized first and presented to the group in order to get a better grasp on the topic and analysis.
**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?** <br />
Maybe using software like Tableau to make data visualizations or other interactive methods to present the data and findings.
